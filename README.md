My Opinion on Writing :

So, i'm a kind of student who practice deliberate learning using <i>Feynman Technique<i> on my study.
<i>Feynman Technique<i> is a type of learning that we are pushed to learn by teaching someone, 
for example a 10 year old kid, or write about the subject that we learn. So, how is this type of learning 
correlated to writing skills? 

Writing needs us to understand on the subjects of what we're write. So, it means that by writing,
 we are also learning, or even mastering that subject. Then, why writing skill is very important? 
 To me, that is because when we're writing on some subject, we're not just mastering the subject 
 for ourselves, but also letting people know, and share the information to them about the topics 
 that we're writing on. And also, <i>sharing is caring<i>.
